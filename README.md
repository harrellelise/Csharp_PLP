# C# Tutorial and Minesweeper Game
### Overview

This repository contains two main components:

A tutorial on how to use C# programming language, created as part of a class project for the "Programming Languages" course during the Fall 2024 semester. The tutorial is located in the Final_Tutorial folder.

A Minesweeper game built using C#, which demonstrates the concepts learned throughout the course. The game files are stored in the MineSweeper folder.

### Folder Structure
Final_Tutorial/: A step-by-step guide for learning C# with explanations, code examples, and practical applications.
MineSweeper/: The complete implementation of the Minesweeper game using C#.

### Purpose
Final_Tutorial: The purpose of the tutorial is to guide beginners through the basics of C#, providing clear explanations of fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, loops, conditionals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more. It is designed to help students and new programmers get started with C# in an approachable way.

MineSweeper: The Minesweeper game was developed as a fun and practical project to demonstrate my understanding and application of C#. This game involves generating a grid of hidden mines, where players must avoid mines while uncovering safe spaces, similar to the classic Minesweeper game. It utilizes core programming skills such as handling user input, random number generation, and implementing game logic.
