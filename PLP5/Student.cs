// In your programming language, do the following (or explain why it canâ€™t be done as described):

// Create an object (a simple Person or Date object is fine)
// Give the object class attributes (aka instance variables)
// Give the object functions
// Create an object that inherits from the first object (e.g., Student or Appointment) with some attributes and functions of its own
// Test how to instantiate both types of objects, call their functions, and modify their variables.
